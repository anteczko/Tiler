Tiler, one script that allows mouseless workflow in every window manager. It will handle changing active window focus using keyboard and tiling windows.

Functions:
-move focus
-move windows
-swap windows
-resize windows
-tile windows

TODO:
+get 'linked' workspaces 
+get list of windows on workspaces
+get focused window
+get ID of window <direction>
+move focus <direction>
+swap windows <direction>
+move windows <direction>
+move/resize windows, while snapping to grid
-resize tiled window
 -add option to revert back all windows in case resizing can't be executed
  -make backups of all windows that will be changed
  -make resizeWindowDir() function return widnow or False in case of problem
  -if any of windows will cause problem, revert all to previous states
 +get list of windows that are 'sticking' to <dir> side of window


Arguments
<direction> - moves focus in that direction
swap <dir> - swaps current window with window at specified direciton
move <dir> - moves window in direction

Ideas:
-move focus
-swap windows
-move windows
-move workspaces
-resize window
-resize tiled window
-inflate window (widnow will become as bit as possible but the way to not obstruckt windows around)
-moving floating windows atop of already tiled ones (put program window 'into' tiled windows)
-defined layouts
-save/load set of programs
-


Workflow:
<single window opening>
-empty workspace
-open program
-click button -> program detects only program on that workspace -> maximizes window
<second widnow>
-open program
-program is opened atop of already existing (and tield window program)
-mod+arrow to split window underneath and tile second window on <dir> side
<third widnow>
-open program
-you can move third 'floating' widnow around mod+<dir>, window sits atop of and jumps aroudn like focus of widnow, but it also reszies to be little smaller that widnow underneath
-mod+arrow to split window underneath and tile second window on <dir> side
<holes filling>
-if there is more than one window and on there is a empty space
-

Functions:
+move window
+swap windows
+resize window
+resize tiled window
-move tiled window
-move focus
 -different focus modes:
  -

Ideas:
-make all windows snap to grid, their x0,y0 point and also while resizing
 -GRID variable must be common denominator of screen height and width

Controls:
Tiled/Floating
mod+<dir> - change focus
mod+shift+<dir> - move/swap window
mod+control+<dir> - resize window



Windows types:
 -floating
  -they aren't aligned nor have parent
 -tiled
  -their position and size is standarized
   -except terminals widnows, they are retarded
  -they can't overlap
   -TODO add multi resize
   -TODO add checking if widnows will not overlapp after moving/resizing
 -child
  -special kind of floating window
  -sits atop of already tiled windows
  -it's size mimics size of parent widnow but it's a bit smaller to show it's dependence to it's parent window
  -mod+<dir> moves child around already tiled windows
  -mod+shift+<dir> places child window on place of parent one, by splitting paren't place in half dependednt on <dir>

V2TODO:
+make data structure with id of window
+add option to load all widnows
+add option to update data about winow by it's id
+add calibrating variables (size of window decorations)
+add temp functions for moving and resizing windows
+added resize function
+added moveWindow function
+add focus changing
+add supporting functions for focusing etc.
+add swaping widnows
 +for tiled windows
+add conditions for resizing windows
+add resizing tiled windows
+add calibration option
-add moving tiled windows
-add blacklist for windows (panels etc.)
-add workspaces support
